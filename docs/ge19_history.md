# GE19 reduced weakly nonlinear track — persistent history

Last updated: 2026-09-21

Branch:

`physics-first-gravitational-elasticity`

This file is the persistent scientific history for the GE19 reduced weakly nonlinear construction.

Historical classifications are immutable. A FAIL is never relabelled after a later repair succeeds. Implementation failures, diagnostic audits, science FAILs and certified PASS results are kept distinct.

## Current checkpoint

The latest executed and frozen diagnostic is Repair18:

`GE19_REPAIR18_ZERO_COORDINATE_CONSTRAINT_PROJECTED_MOMENTUM_BOUNDARY_AUDIT_COMPLETE`

with route

`ZERO_COORDINATE_CONSTRAINT_PROJECTED_MOMENTUM_BOUNDARY_CERTIFIED`.

Repair18 result-freeze commit:

`3892ee81c8030ee7c5131d1aaf1f333cbdbe6509`.

Repair18 JSON SHA-256:

`d5603138c2f488413686323d1241613f6ef707b586116aa7fe865ae25ceb0edc`.

The zero-coordinate projected-momentum boundary passes all frozen gates in all 714 material cases:

- scaled constraint residual max: `2.482534153108436e-16`;
- lapse backward error max: `2.639993079262776e-16`;
- shift backward error max: `3.2234628832120975e-16`;
- eliminated algebraic residual max: `2.457039030496151e-16`;
- rank 2 / augmented rank 2 throughout;
- 714/714 PASS;
- all material outputs finite.

Primary/control boundary reproducibility is also closed:

- projected p0 relative L2 difference max: `0.0`;
- determined qdot0 relative L2 difference max: `6.468697709110601e-15`.

Repair18 therefore converts the Repair17 manifold-existence result into one unique reproducible finite-window boundary prescription:

`q0=0`, with canonical `p0` determined by the frozen doubly equilibrated GELSD lapse+shift projection.

Repair19 is now **LOCKED / READY / NOT YET LOCALLY EXECUTED**.

Repair19 reruns the exact Repair14 H3/Z20 propagation with only this initial-boundary replacement. Repair07 canonical propagation, Repair14 source construction, Repair13 parent, all grids/modes/C/beta values and all Stage-B gates are unchanged.

Repair19 dedicated prelock:

`35617194247` — SUCCESS.

Repair19 runner-head static audit:

`35617378275` — SUCCESS.

Locked Repair19 runner commit:

`2972b32a019145a3b4ec0ce178466564caa7005e`.

No q20 or H4/Z21 is licensed until the Repair19 propagation result is frozen PASS.

## Scientific status in one line

`H1/background certified -> first H3/Z20 attempt failed shift constraint -> naive zero boundaries excluded -> full canonical manifold exists -> Repair18 projected boundary certified in 714/714 cases -> Repair19 H3/Z20 propagation is next`.

## Certified base

### Repair13 — self-consistent reduced-background H1 reclosure

Classification:

`GE19_REPAIR13_SELF_CONSISTENT_REDUCED_BACKGROUND_H1_RECLOSURE_PASS`.

Result-freeze commit:

`5461f89f77f91e931f14abb6a2e5014597e0cb6f`.

This is the current certified first-order parent.

Reduced homogeneous background:

`H_red(a)^2 = (Q K_Q-K)/3 + C/a^3 + rho_lambda`.

Frozen scalar charge:

`a^3 K_Q = I0`.

Global Stage-A controls:

- Friedmann relative L2 max: `5.3148141262610533e-17`;
- pressure identity relative L2 max: `4.9400107598617e-16`;
- canonical/linear residual max: `4.3389056048311334e-16`;
- shift backward error max: `4.54500027983174e-7`;
- anisotropy backward error max: `2.0133086499281873e-16`;
- initial dynamic match max: `5.826069165486057e-14`;
- Nt64/Nt32 state relative L2 max: `1.317515813217615e-4`.

All frozen Stage-A gates PASS.

Scientific conclusion:

the reduced Einstein+AeST+dust+Lambda first-order system closes on its own homogeneous on-shell background.

The previous Repair11 residual was dominated by background/operator inconsistency, not by a missing post-hoc CLASS momentum source.

## H3 / Z20 attempt

### Repair14 — first self-consistent reduced H3/Z20 particular solve

Classification:

`GE19_REPAIR14_SELF_CONSISTENT_REDUCED_H3_Z20_PARTICULAR_FAIL`.

Result-freeze commit:

`7ba8b312f7dd8ca7035958be2abdf03df98a5bae`.

Frozen output hashes:

- JSON/FULL log:
  `741da95a0aaffa31e27f2b05d42b8a7f011574013de8639812e453d7b130fe57`;
- NPZ:
  `b72626bd45b02b537d21f035fc8c746eb06eee669869c4aea921861328303c42`.

Solved equation:

`L_total Z20 = -Q_total(Z10,Z10) - 2 Y2[Z10]`.

The exact Lambda common-direction second source was included.

PASS controls:

- frozen Repair13 provenance exact;
- all sources finite;
- Nx1024/Nx2048 source convergence:
  `1.1166216258507802e-12`;
- anisotropy constraint:
  `5.176430012533252e-16`;
- Nt64/Nt32 state convergence:
  `5.470805059400488e-4`;
- all C and beta cases complete;
- all outputs finite.

FAIL controls:

- primary linear residual:
  `1.3665579847915249e-8 > 1e-8`;
- primary shift backward error:
  `1.6504055271415055 >> 1e-6`.

Control-grid shift is similarly large:

`1.6473553166699726`.

Interpretation:

the candidate Z20 is numerically stable and converged in space/time but is **not constraint-certified**.

Repair14 does not license q20 or H4/Z21.

### Descriptive source hierarchy from Repair14

Across the frozen C envelope:

- Einstein+AeST quadratic source L2: approximately `1.446e10`;
- dust quadratic source L2: approximately `8.4e-6`;
- Lambda quadratic source L2: approximately `3.09e-16`;
- Y_H3 L2: approximately `0.030--0.055`.

Thus the H3 memory Y source is only approximately `2e-12--4e-12` of the baseline analytic quadratic source for this frozen direction.

The beta0={1,0.5,0.1} Z20 candidates are correspondingly almost identical at approximately `1e-12` relative level.

This is descriptive because Repair14 failed Stage B.

## Initial-surface diagnostics after Repair14

### Repair15 — zero-dynamic-velocity compatibility audit

Classification:

`GE19_REPAIR15_H3_INITIAL_SHIFT_NOETHER_COMPATIBILITY_AUDIT_COMPLETE`.

Route:

`INITIAL_SOURCE_INCOMPATIBILITY`.

Result-freeze commit:

`e2d642eb528fab10aa4d3ba0a2afc94b2dcacbaf`.

JSON SHA-256:

`a8c86b6056a3d6ab2f6f443850bef34881452b4a11b32bb6a66e2ac7920f1e50`.

Frozen test:

- q20 values zero;
- q20 cosmic-time derivatives zero;
- only N20 and delta_varrho20 algebraic.

For material cases, the row-scaled 3x2 system formed by lapse, dust density and shift has coefficient rank 2 but augmented rank 3.

Global compatibility residuals:

- least-squares relative residual max:
  `0.24244997981714522`;
- left-null compatibility residual max:
  `0.2424499798171455`.

Threshold:

`1e-6`.

Conclusion:

no choice of only N20 and delta_varrho20 can close lapse+density+shift under the frozen q=0,qdot=0 initial convention.

This result does not prove that the quadratic source itself violates Noether/Bianchi compatibility.

### Repair16 — canonical-zero initial-state audit

Classification:

`GE19_REPAIR16_CANONICAL_ZERO_INITIAL_STATE_AUDIT_COMPLETE`.

Route:

`QUADRATIC_SOURCE_NOETHER_INCOMPATIBILITY_REMAINS`.

Result-freeze commit:

`d5a619495f0f8fb2da53528b46476a15c1a32922`.

JSON SHA-256:

`768d5a2de7cd62059e7149a4765ab5a9663eef708fc29989c05192f607c5bf68`.

Frozen canonical boundary:

`y0=(S,u,phi,T,pS,pu,pphi,pT)=0`.

The algebraic reconstruction is allowed to determine N20, delta_varrho20 and qdot20.

Global material-case controls:

- algebraic residual max:
  `7.465407808870082e-16`;
- independent lapse backward error max:
  `1.0`;
- independent shift backward error max:
  `1.0`;
- anisotropy backward error max:
  `6.394777335818628e-16`;
- local algebraic scaled condition number max:
  `3.1343173893632996`;
- all outputs finite.

Conclusion:

canonical y0=0 is not on the forced H3 constraint manifold.

Important interpretation boundary:

this still does not prove that the frozen quadratic source is intrinsically inconsistent. At finite z=1.5, a nonzero forcing source need not admit the zero canonical state.

## Repair17 — full canonical initial-manifold audit

Classification:

`GE19_REPAIR17_FULL_CANONICAL_INITIAL_MANIFOLD_AUDIT_COMPLETE`.

Route:

`FINITE_WINDOW_ZERO_BOUNDARY_INADMISSIBLE_SOURCE_COMPATIBLE`.

Result-freeze commit:

`1ce72e3c3a732be59c1e390c8ef67859348b76c6`.

Frozen output hashes:

- JSON/FULL log:
  `f81ad8ef52eb3a7ff4d4286670a62c830f17872459f43812b059447f85e14184`;
- outer runner:
  `8cb82e530f104895bd2d22cd6ae1bb86c36d64dd80eb9418b3c6a6bbe7a5c1e0`.

Repair17 tests the exact same frozen Repair14 source on the full canonical initial manifold

`y=(S,u,phi,T,pS,pu,pphi,pT)`.

Full-y result:

- material cases: `714/714` pass;
- constraint residual max: `8.892022036425179e-13`;
- lapse backward error max: `2.6457320679749983e-16`;
- shift backward error max: `1.8699495216551784e-10`;
- eliminated algebraic residual max: `2.388467729664837e-16`;
- rank 2 and augmented rank 2 throughout;
- all finite.

Restricted q-only states fail the eliminated algebraic gate in all material cases.

Restricted p-only states are much closer:

- algebraic residual max `1.6529397640806795e-16`;
- constraint residual max `1.9160597062254987e-10`;
- shift backward error max `1.0092587566692186e-5`;
- `396/714` satisfy all current gates.

Scientific conclusion:

the quadratic source is not shown to violate the initial Noether/constraint compatibility. The finite-window zero boundaries used in Repairs 14-16 were inadmissible.

Boundary-selection caveat:

the full 2x8 system has six null directions. Repair17's Euclidean minimum-norm representative is an existence witness, not yet a physical initial prescription. Its norm reaches `1908119.6665826605` in the strongest material case.

The next gate must therefore freeze and certify a coordinate/physics-motivated constraint-compatible boundary before any H3 propagation is rerun.

## Repair18 — zero-coordinate projected-momentum boundary

Classification:

`GE19_REPAIR18_ZERO_COORDINATE_CONSTRAINT_PROJECTED_MOMENTUM_BOUNDARY_AUDIT_COMPLETE`.

Route:

`ZERO_COORDINATE_CONSTRAINT_PROJECTED_MOMENTUM_BOUNDARY_CERTIFIED`.

Result-freeze commit:

`3892ee81c8030ee7c5131d1aaf1f333cbdbe6509`.

Frozen output hashes:

- JSON/FULL log:
  `d5603138c2f488413686323d1241613f6ef707b586116aa7fe865ae25ceb0edc`;
- outer runner:
  `f50fe69000c31ddbb57228ae5dc15c2fc6c641e4adb08e30fda6ad3e0677f2c5`.

Boundary:

- `q0=(S20,u20,phi20,T20)=0` exactly;
- `p0=(pS20,pu20,pphi20,pT20)` from the frozen 2x4 lapse+shift projection;
- doubly equilibrated GELSD minimum norm;
- exactly four iterative-refinement sweeps.

Global result:

- `714/714` material cases PASS;
- scaled constraint residual max `2.482534153108436e-16`;
- lapse max `2.639993079262776e-16`;
- shift max `3.2234628832120975e-16`;
- algebraic residual max `2.457039030496151e-16`;
- anisotropy max `6.394777335818628e-16`;
- rank 2 throughout.

Primary/control projected p0 is identical to machine representation, with qdot0 relative L2 mismatch <= `6.468697709110601e-15`.

Raw p0 and qdot0 norms are coordinate-scale sensitive and are monitored descriptively only. The scaled solution norm remains <= `0.577350276667655`.

Scientific conclusion:

the finite-window initial boundary is now uniquely and reproducibly certified. The next licensed step is H3/Z20 propagation with this exact boundary and unchanged Stage-B gates.

## What is certified now

Certified:

- NL0B covariant memory construction;
- weakly nonlinear source infrastructure;
- GE06 analytic Einstein+AeST directional generator;
- GE07 pressureless-matter directional generator;
- Repair13 self-consistent reduced background;
- Repair13 reduced H1 / Z10 Stage-A closure.

Not certified:

- Z20;
- q20;
- H4/Z21;
- finite-eta nonlinear trajectory;
- nonlinear lensing or nonlinear matter observables;
- any real-data nonlinear-memory inference.

## Data-readiness boundary

The project is **not yet ready for a nonlinear real-data claim**.

The shortest valid route is:

`Repair19 constraint-certified Z20 propagation -> observable bridge -> real-data confrontation`.

For the full nonlinear-memory state claim:

`constraint-certified Z20 -> q20 -> H4/Z21 -> observable bridge -> data`.

Lensing remains a natural first observable after state certification because the model acts directly through gravitational potentials. CMB/SPT high-l and structure probes remain later comparison channels.

No observational result may be used to choose or tune a repair in the theory chain.

---

## Immediate action

Run the locked local Repair19 H3/Z20 propagation.

Until that result is frozen, the canonical project status is:

**Repair13 H1 PASS; Repair14 H3/Z20 FAIL; Repair15/16 zero-boundary diagnostics frozen; Repair17 manifold PASS-for-existence; Repair18 projected finite-window boundary PASS; Repair19 H3/Z20 propagation READY / NOT YET EXECUTED.**
